# Language Model with mTEDx
This folder contains recipes for training language models for the mTEDx Dataset.
This recipe supports only an RNN-based LM.
The scripts rely on the HuggingFace dataset, which manages data reading and
loading from large text corpora.

Before running this recipe, make sure to read the mTEDx
[README](../../README.md) file first.

# Extra Dependency:
Make sure you have the HuggingFace dataset installed. If not, run the following
command:
```bash
pip install -r extra_requirements.txt
```

# How to run:

To train a RNNLM on single/multiple language(s), run the following command:

```bash
python train.py hparams/train.yaml
```
